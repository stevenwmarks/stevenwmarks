### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Former freelance writer/editor turning to the world of Three.js
Have worked my way through Bruno Simon's Three.js Journey course (which is remarkable) and starting to experiment
Expect that I will be using Blender and GSAP along the way
And Shaders which seems to be the solution to every problem
Person 1: "Can I do this?"
Person 2 "Yeah, but you'll have to write a shader."
